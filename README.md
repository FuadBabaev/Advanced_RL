# Advanced RL

A small, hands-on set of notebooks exploring classical and deep reinforcement learning: Value Iteration, the Deep Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), and Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C). The emphasis is on clear training loops, readable NumPy/PyTorch code, and compact experiments on toy control tasks.

## Contents
- Value Iteration from scratch on grid/MDP examples.
- Policy search with the (Deep) Cross-Entropy Method; sampling, elite selection, and parameter updates.
- Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) with baseline/value head and training curves.
